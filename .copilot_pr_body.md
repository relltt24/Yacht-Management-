This PR adds a minimal Firebase backend scaffold and CI to stabilize Studio builds.

## Changes:

- Cloud Functions scaffold (Node 18) with Express API and sample endpoints
- Firestore rules (conservative defaults)
- firebase.json, .firebaserc, and apphosting.yaml for Firebase Studio
- GitHub Actions workflow for CI and deploy
- Tests (jest + supertest) for basic API endpoints
- README with setup and migration plan

## Post-merge steps:

1. Add `FIREBASE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT` secret in repository Settings -> Secrets and variables -> Actions:
   - Name: `FIREBASE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT`
   - Value: paste the JSON from Firebase service account (do NOT commit)
2. Confirm Studio runtime env values in Firebase Studio (apphosting.yaml runtime.env placeholders)
3. Merge and monitor CI + Firebase Studio builds.

**No secrets are added in this PR.**
