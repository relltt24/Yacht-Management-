# GitHub Actions Workflow Fix Summary

## Problem Statement

The GitHub Actions workflows were failing with the following issues:

1. **Workflow Run 18704942489** - failure - The workflow was trying to create Next.js configuration files for a non-Next.js project
2. **Workflow Run 18704896255** - failure - Missing build scripts and TypeScript configuration
3. **Multiple runs** - "action_required" status - Missing Firebase deployment secrets
4. **Mismatched configuration** - Workflow used Node 18 while apphosting.yaml specified Node 20

## Root Causes Identified

1. **Wrong project type assumption**: The "auto fix-and-create-pr.yml" workflow was creating Next.js config files and running Next.js commands (tsc, eslint, npm run build) for what is actually a simple Express.js backend with static HTML.

2. **Missing Firebase workflows**: The Firebase hosting deployment workflows were referenced in workflow history but didn't exist in the repository.

3. **Missing build process**: The package.json only had a "start" script, no "build" script, causing the workflow to fail.

4. **Node version mismatch**: Workflows specified Node 18 while the actual app configuration (apphosting.yaml) required Node 20.

5. **Missing secrets**: Firebase deployment requires FIREBASE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT and FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID secrets which weren't documented.

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Removed Incorrect Workflow
- Deleted "auto fix-and-create-pr.yml" which was trying to enforce Next.js/TypeScript builds
- This workflow was fundamentally incompatible with the project structure

### 2. Created Proper CI Workflow (ci.yml)
```yaml
name: CI — Build and Test
on:
  pull_request:
    branches: [ main, backend-setup ]
  push:
    branches: [ main, backend-setup ]
```

**Features:**
- Installs dependencies with `npm ci`
- Runs ESLint (optional, won't fail if not configured)
- Tests the Express server by:
  - Starting the server
  - Checking `/healthz` endpoint
  - Checking `/` endpoint
- Uses Node.js 20 (matching apphosting.yaml)

### 3. Created Firebase Deployment Workflows

**firebase-hosting-merge.yml** - Production deployment:
- Triggers on merge to main branch
- Deploys to Firebase Hosting live channel
- Requires secrets: FIREBASE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT, FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID

**firebase-hosting-pull-request.yml** - Preview deployment:
- Triggers on pull requests
- Creates preview channels for testing
- Posts preview URL as PR comment
- Security: Only runs for PRs from the same repository

### 4. Fixed Configuration Files

**apphosting.yaml**: Ensured consistent formatting

**firebase.json**: Already correctly configured to serve from root directory

**.gitignore**: Created to exclude:
- node_modules/
- .firebase/
- Build artifacts
- Environment files
- IDE files

### 5. Added Documentation

**README.md**: 
- Project overview
- Getting started guide
- Deployment information
- Contributing guidelines

**DEPLOYMENT.md**:
- Detailed Firebase setup instructions
- How to create FIREBASE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT secret
- How to find FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID
- Troubleshooting guide for common issues

## Validation Performed

1. ✅ **YAML Syntax**: All workflow files validated
2. ✅ **CodeQL Security Scan**: 0 alerts found
3. ✅ **Local Server Test**: Server starts and responds correctly
4. ✅ **Dependencies**: npm install completes successfully
5. ✅ **Health Check**: `/healthz` endpoint returns "ok"

## Files Changed

### Added
- `.github/workflows/ci.yml` - New CI workflow
- `.github/workflows/firebase-hosting-merge.yml` - Production deployment
- `.github/workflows/firebase-hosting-pull-request.yml` - PR preview deployment
- `.gitignore` - Git ignore rules
- `README.md` - Project documentation
- `DEPLOYMENT.md` - Deployment guide
- `package-lock.json` - Dependency lock file

### Modified
- `apphosting.yaml` - Formatting cleanup

### Removed
- `.github/workflows/auto fix-and-create-pr.yml` - Incompatible workflow

## Next Steps for Repository Owner

To complete the setup, add these secrets to GitHub repository settings:

1. **FIREBASE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT**
   - Go to Firebase Console → Project Settings → Service Accounts
   - Generate new private key
   - Add entire JSON as secret value

2. **FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID**
   - Copy from Firebase Console → Project Settings → General
   - Add as secret value

See `DEPLOYMENT.md` for detailed instructions.

## Expected Behavior After Fix

1. **On Pull Request**:
   - CI workflow runs and tests the server
   - Firebase preview deployment creates a preview URL
   - Preview URL is commented on the PR

2. **On Merge to Main**:
   - CI workflow runs
   - Firebase deployment to production
   - Live site is updated

3. **No More "action_required" Status**:
   - Once secrets are added, workflows will complete automatically
   - No manual approval needed

## Security Notes

- All workflows follow least-privilege principle
- PR preview only runs for same-repository PRs
- No secrets exposed in logs
- CodeQL security analysis passed with 0 alerts
